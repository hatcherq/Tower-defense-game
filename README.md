# Tower-defense-game
In the game, the player must be able to place and 
upgrade towers strategically on a map to prevent enemies from reaching the wizard’s house. 
Mana is the currency of the game used to buy and upgrade towers. Each time an enemy reaches the wizard’s house,
mana must be expended to banish it. 

The goal is to survive all waves of enemies without letting the
wizard’s mana run down to 0.
